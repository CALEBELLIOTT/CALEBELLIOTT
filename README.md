### Hi there 👋

I'm glad that you have arrived at my github page! I am a full-stack web development student at Boise Codeworks. I got started coding in January of 2022 and have been passionately learning ever since. 

My path to landing on this career has been a winding one- from graduating magna cum laude with a bachelors of science in Biology, to earning my EMT certification, I have dabbled a little bit in everything. However, upon learning about the tech career path and arriving at Boise Codeworks, my excitement for programming has only increased and I am confident that this is what I want to do!

A little bit about me...

- 🏃‍♂️ I love to exercise and regularly go to HIIT classes
- 🧗‍♂️ I really enjoy climbing whenever I get the chance
- 💰 I am an avid investor and even have a blog where I discuss topics in finance
- ⛺️ Backpacking and camping are some of my favorite activites
