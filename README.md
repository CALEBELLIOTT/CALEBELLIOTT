### Hi there 👋

I'm glad that you have arrived at my github page! I am a full-stack Software Developer located in Los Angeles. I love programming and have been passionatly learning ever since "hello world".

My path to landing on this career has been a winding one- from graduating with a bachelors of science in Biology, to earning my EMT certification, I have dabbled a little bit in everything. However, upon learning about the tech career path and beginning my coding journey, my excitement for programming has only increased and I wake up every morning ready to tackle new problems. 

I'm currently working with React, Redux, Material UI, Node.js, GraphQL, and Amazon DynamoDB.

Feel free to reach out! I like a good conversation with new people :)

A little bit about me...

- 🏃‍♂️ I love to exercise and regularly go to HIIT classes
- 🧗‍♂️ I really enjoy climbing whenever I get the chance
- 💰 I am an avid investor and even have a blog where I discuss topics in finance
- ⛺️ Backpacking and camping are some of my favorite activites
